# docs-readability

> Visual Studio Code extension which indicates reading complexity of markdown documentation

## Usage

When a markdown document is opened or edited, the readable content is extracted and reading complexity is measured. The score represents a school reading grade, but extends beyond school ages. For instance a score of 9 is a reading age of 14 - 15.

The resulting score leads to one of five categorizations: 

* Elementary: 0 - 11
* Appropriate: 12 - 16
* Challenging: 17 - 21
* Esoteric: 21 - 26
* Baffling: 27+

Each categorization is represented by a book emoji in the status bar:

* Elementary: ðŸ“˜
* Appropriate: ðŸ“—
* Challenging: ðŸ“™
* Esoteric: ðŸ“•
* Baffling: ðŸ“š

A tooltip is displayed when hovering over the emoji which displays the categorization
and score.

Note the score given is a loose guide and could use further refinement and analysis in its application to technical documentation.
